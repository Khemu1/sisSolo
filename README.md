# **Project Idea**
**Student Information System (SIS)**
# **Overview**

The Student Information System (SIS) is designed to manage students and teachers data. The system provides features for course enrollment , teacher assignment and student assignment.

# **How it Works**
**User Registration:** Students register for the system, providing basic information such as username, name, address, and desired courses.

**Teacher Assignment:** Upon registration, students are assigned to teachers based on the courses they choose. If no teacher is available for a particular course, the student will remain unassigned until a teacher registers for that course.

**Course Enrollment:** Students can enroll in courses from a selection of 23 available courses. The system ensures that students are only assigned to courses for which a teacher is available.

**Teacher Registration:** Teachers register for the system, providing their credentials and indicating the courses they are qualified to teach.

**Course Management:** Teachers can see enrolled students

**Responsive Design:** The system is designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and devices for a seamless user experience.

# **Technologies Used**
**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
